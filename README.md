# React Mobx Express Starter
## What is this?
This is a basic bootstrap for a stack that I have really fallen in love with - React applications using Mobx for state management and Express for server handling.

## What's included?
- React
- Mobx
- Express
- Eslint using slightly modified Airbnb rules
- Webpack 4, including dev server

## Getting started
To get started simply clone this repository and run `npm install` to get all the dependencies.

Then run `npm run dev` to start the dev server. The dev server included Hot Reload and the backend server uses nodemon, so changes you do in the code will be reflected without the need for a reload.

You should probably also create a `.env` file specifying which ports you want the services to run on. Look at `.env.example` for inspiration.
